**Aditya Bobde**

I am a first-year PhD student in [Carlson School of Management](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/) at the [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Ravi Bapna](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/faculty/ravi-bapna). Prior to joining UMN, I spent two years as a Pre-Doc at the [Indian School of Business](https://www.isb.edu/)

At ISB, I worked with [Dr. Sumeet Kumar](https://www.isb.edu/en/faculty/sumeet-kumar.html) and [Dr Rakesh Mallipeddi](https://www.isb.edu/en/faculty/rakesh-mallipeddi.html) on Extensive analysis of social influence patterns and their evolution over time using deep learning. I also worked with [Dr. Ravi Bapna](https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/faculty/ravi-bapna) on Market reactions to AI algorithm-related events. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with Achamma Thomas on my Bachelor Thesis on Multimodal Machine Learning for content tone.
