My current research focuses on developing empirical methods to measure and benchmark the AI and technology orientation of corporate boards in US public companies. Another research focuses on evaluating leading large language models (LLMs) for triaging pandemic help requests from social media, with a focus on urgency scoring and bias analysis.

At the Indian School of Business, my research explored the social impact of memes at times of significant events, particularly studying public responses to the U.S. Supreme Court's abortion ruling. As part of my undergraduate thesis, I developed a multimodal emotion recognition model that integrated three modalities: audio, visual, and textual data, for better emotional content assessment. MML has shown great promise in enhancing accuracy and resilience in emotion recognition systems via cross-modal interactions, through various fusion techniques.
