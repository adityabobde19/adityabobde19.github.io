My research focuses on building methodologies that help with data-driven decision-making, empowering product managers to make better use of insights. I also work on advancing solutions in Multimodal Machine Learning and Large Language Models, focusing on some of the most important open challenges in these areas.

At the Indian School of Business, my research explored the social impact of memes at times of significant events, particularly studying public responses to the U.S. Supreme Court's abortion ruling. This investigation deepened my interest in how social media artifacts shape public opinion and catalyze social change. I aim to expand this work by exploring the societal and political implications of AI-generated content in digital spaces, focusing on the intersection of social media dynamics and societal impact during my PhD studies. 

As part of my undergraduate thesis, I developed a multimodal emotion recognition model that integrated three modalities: audio, visual, and textual data, for better emotional content assessment. Multimodal Machine Learning has shown great promise in enhancing accuracy and resilience in emotion recognition systems via cross-modal interactions, through various fusion techniques. This work pointed out the potential of the multimodal approach to further deepen the understanding and analysis of digital communications.
