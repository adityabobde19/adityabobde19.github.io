# Research

My current research focuses on developing empirical methods to measure and benchmark the AI and technology orientation of corporate boards in US public companies. Another research focuses on evaluating leading large language models (LLMs) for triaging pandemic help requests from social media, with a focus on urgency scoring and bias analysis.

At the Indian School of Business, my research explored the social impact of memes at times of significant events, particularly studying public reactions to the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. I examined how memes influence digital political discourse and social media engagement across different platforms and demographics.

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on Multimodal Machine Learning for content tone analysis, combining text and visual data to better understand communication patterns and sentiment in digital media.
